## EU Presidency

Germany will get receive the presidency on 1st July 2020 from Croatia.

The animation shows which country has had the EU presidency between 1990 and 2020. EU has had presidency since 1958. First country to hold the presidency was Belgium. The presidency rotates within the membership every six months.

At each point of time countries in yellow present the countries part of the EU and the country holding EU presidency is marked in blue. 

The map shows the current borders for the countries. For example former state of Yugoslavia is therefore shows as separate countries already in 1990.

The presidency of the Council rotates among the EU member states every 6 months. During this 6-month period, the presidency chairs meetings at every level in the Council, helping to ensure the continuity of the EU's work in the Council.

Member states holding the presidency work together closely in groups of three, called 'trios'. This system was introduced by the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The trio sets long-term goals and prepares a common agenda determining the topics and major issues that will be addressed by the Council over an 18 month period. On the basis of this programme, each of the three countries prepares its own more detailed 6-month programme.

The current trio is made up of the presidencies of the Romania, Finland and Croatia. Next, the tenth trio, will be Germany, Portugal and Slovenia.

The presidency is responsible for driving forward the Council's work on EU legislation, ensuring the continuity of the EU agenda, orderly legislative processes and cooperation among member states. To do this, the presidency must act as an honest and neutral broker.

The presidency has two main tasks:
1. Planning and chairing meetings in the Council and its preparatory bodies
2. Representing the Council in relations with the other EU institutions
